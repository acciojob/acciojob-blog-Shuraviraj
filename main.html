                <h1>Brute Force vs. Optimization</h1>
            </a>
            <p>We can say that optimization is one step further than the brute-force method of problem solving. However,
                that does not mean that optimization is always the best answer. In this article, we will discuss brute
                force, optimization, time complexity, and space complexity and compare these methods. We will also
                discuss how to bridge the gap between brute force and optimization. If you are a software developer and
                are puzzled about both of these methods, this article is for you.</p>
